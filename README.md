# C Projects

This repository contains mini projects and practice exercises written in C. The goal is to reinforce concepts such as logic, memory management, data structures, and file handling.

## Structure

```
C/
├── basic_projects/             // Basic syntax, conditionals, loops, functions
├── pointers_and_memory/        // Pointer manipulation and dynamic allocation
├── structs/                    // Projects using structs and nested data
├── data_structures/            // Lists, stacks, queues, binary trees
├── file_handling/               // Reading and writing data to files
├── algorithms/                  // Sorting and searching implementations
├── challenges/                  // Solved problems from URI and The Huxley
└── include/                    // Header files (.h) for shared definitions
```

## Highlights

- Clean and modular code
- Projects focused on one concept at a time
- Practical applications to simulate real problems
- Use of `Makefile` where needed for easier compilation

## Tools

- Language: C (GCC)
- OS: Linux or Windows
- Editor: VS Code or any preferred editor

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
cd path/to/project
gcc main.c -o program
./program
```

For projects with multiple files:
```bash
make
./program
```

## Purpose

This repo is part of my learning process in C and programming in general. Each folder represents a set of skills or a challenge I wanted to understand better and put into practice.
